    "# Hypothesis Testing (Z-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support or reject a claim about the population. The **Z-test** is used when the **population standard deviation** is known, and the **sample size is large** (typically $n \\geq 30$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-test helps determine whether the difference between the **sample mean** and the **population mean** is statistically significant or due to random chance. It is commonly used for:  \n",
    "- Testing whether the sample mean differs from the population mean.  \n",
    "- Comparing two independent sample means.  \n",
    "- Testing population proportions for large samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps in Hypothesis Testing (Z-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate Hypotheses**  \n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis** $H_0$: There is no significant difference between the sample mean and population mean.  \n",
    "     $$H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$$  \n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis** $H_1$: There is a significant difference between the sample mean and population mean.  \n",
    "     $$H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set the Significance Level**  \n",
    "   The significance level is denoted by $\\alpha$ and represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A typical choice is $\\alpha = 0.05$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Z-statistic**  \n",
    "   The Z-statistic measures how far the sample mean is from the population mean in terms of standard errors:  \n",
    "   $$Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}$$  \n",
    "   Where:  \n",
    "   - $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean  \n",
    "   - $\\mu_0$ is the population mean under the null hypothesis  \n",
    "   - $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation  \n",
    "   - $n$ is the sample size  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine the Critical Value or p-value**  \n",
    "   - Use a **Z-table** to find the critical value corresponding to the chosen $\\alpha$.  \n",
    "   - Alternatively, calculate the **p-value**, which is the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the observed Z-statistic if $H_0$ is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Rule**  \n",
    "   - If $|Z| > Z_{\\alpha/2}$ (critical value), reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "   - If the **p-value** is less than $\\alpha$, reject $H_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Conclusion**  \n",
    "   - If $H_0$ is rejected, the sample provides sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.  \n",
    "   - If $H_0$ is not rejected, there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the average height of adults in a population is $\\mu_0 = 170$ cm with a known standard deviation $\\sigma = 5$ cm. A sample of $n = 50$ adults has an average height of $\\bar{X} = 172$ cm. Test at the 5% significance level ($\\alpha = 0.05$) whether the sample mean differs significantly from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hypotheses**:  \n",
    "   $$H_0: \\mu = 170 \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\mu \\neq 170$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Z-statistic**:  \n",
    "   $$Z = \\frac{172 - 170}{5 / \\sqrt{50}} = \\frac{2}{0.707} \\approx 2.83$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine Critical Value**:  \n",
    "   - At $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value from the Z-table is $Z_{0.025} = 1.96$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decision**:  \n",
    "   - Since $|2.83| > 1.96$, reject $H_0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**:  \n",
    "   - The sample mean is significantly different from the population mean at the 5% significance level.\n",
