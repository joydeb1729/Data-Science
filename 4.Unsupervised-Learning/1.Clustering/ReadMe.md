## Clustering Algorithms

### What is Clustering?
Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on inherent patterns. It is widely used in data analysis and pattern recognition.

### Common Clustering Algorithms

#### 1. K-Means Clustering
- A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into `k` clusters.
- Iteratively updates cluster centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance.
- Suitable for well-separated spherical clusters.

#### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
- Builds a hierarchy of clusters using either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.
- Produces a dendrogram that allows visualization of cluster relationships.
- Does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.

#### 3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- A density-based clustering algorithm that groups closely packed points and identifies noise as outliers.
- Does not require specifying the number of clusters explicitly.
- Works well with clusters of arbitrary shapes.

### Applications of Clustering
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Image segmentation in computer vision
- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity and fraud detection
- Document clustering for topic modeling
