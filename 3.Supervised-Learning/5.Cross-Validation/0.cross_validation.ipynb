    "# **Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a statistical technique used to assess the generalization ability of a machine learning model. It splits the dataset into training and validation sets multiple times to ensure that the model performs well on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Purpose of Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- Prevents overfitting by ensuring the model performs well across different data splits.\n",
    "- Provides a robust estimate of model performance by evaluating on multiple validation sets.\n",
    "- Helps in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Types of Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(a) Holdout Method**\n",
    "- Splits the dataset into a single training set and a single validation set (e.g., 80% training, 20% validation).\n",
    "- Quick and simple but may provide biased estimates if the split is not representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(b) Repeated Random Sub-Sampling**\n",
    "- Randomly splits the dataset into training and validation sets multiple times.\n",
    "- Averages the results for better reliability.\n",
    "- Less deterministic and may still suffer from unrepresentative splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Detailed Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(a) Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Uses $n$ training-validation splits, where $n$ is the number of samples. For each split:\n",
    "  - One data point is used as the validation set.\n",
    "  - The remaining $n-1$ data points are used for training.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  1. Maximizes training data for each iteration.\n",
    "  2. Provides an unbiased estimate of model performance.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "  1. Computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "  2. High variance in validation scores since each split has only one validation sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(b) Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Similar to LOOCV, but instead of leaving out one sample, $p$ samples are left out for validation in each split.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  1. Allows for more flexibility than LOOCV.\n",
    "  2. Useful for smaller datasets.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "  1. Computationally expensive as the number of splits grows combinatorially with $p$ and $n$.\n",
    "  2. Not practical for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(c) K-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Splits the dataset into $k$ equally-sized (or nearly equal) subsets (folds). For each fold:\n",
    "  - One fold is used as the validation set.\n",
    "  - The remaining $k-1$ folds are used for training.\n",
    "  - The process repeats $k$ times, and results are averaged.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  1. Efficient and less computationally expensive than LOOCV.\n",
    "  2. Ensures every data point is used for validation exactly once.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "  1. May not work well with imbalanced datasets unless stratified sampling is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(d) Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Similar to K-Fold but ensures that the distribution of classes in each fold is approximately the same as the original dataset.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  1. Works well with imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "  2. Provides more reliable estimates for classification problems.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "  1. Slightly more complex implementation than standard K-Fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Time Series Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Definition**: Splits the data sequentially, ensuring that the training set always occurs before the validation set.\n",
    "- Suitable for time-dependent data where future values should not influence past predictions.\n",
    "- Techniques include sliding windows and expanding windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Nested Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- Used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- Consists of an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning and an outer loop for performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
