# **Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model learns to map inputs to outputs using labeled data. It is widely used for predictive tasks where historical data is available.

## **Key Concepts**

### **1. Definition**
- The model is trained on a dataset that contains input-output pairs (features and labels).
- The goal is to learn a mapping function $f(x) = y$ that predicts $y$ (output) given $x$ (input).
- Supervised learning problems are broadly classified into:
  - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
  - **Classification**: Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam).

### **2. Dataset Components**
- **Features ($X$)**: Independent variables that are used as inputs.
- **Target ($y$)**: Dependent variable or label to be predicted.
- **Training Set**: Subset of data used to train the model.
- **Test Set**: Subset of data used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

### **3. Steps in Supervised Learning**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect and preprocess data (e.g., cleaning, scaling, encoding).
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose an appropriate algorithm based on the task (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees).
3. **Training**:
   - Use the training set to fit the model and learn parameters.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on unseen data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.
5. **Optimization**:
   - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
6. **Deployment**:
   - Apply the trained model to make predictions on real-world data.

### **5. Key Metrics**
#### **For Classification**:
- **Accuracy**: $\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}}$
- **Precision**: $\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}}$
- **Recall**: $\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}$
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

#### **For Regression**:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared errors.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $\sqrt{\text{MSE}}$.
- **R-Squared**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.

### **6. Challenges in Supervised Learning**
- **Overfitting**: The model performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Regularization or pruning can help mitigate this.
- **Underfitting**: The model fails to capture the underlying patterns in data. Increasing model complexity can help.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Class distributions are skewed, leading to biased predictions. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights can address this issue.
